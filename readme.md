# MusicStudio project

I was working on a big Laravel project for a music studio located in Argentina. The project included a complete customizable website with a Radio section, Blog, Discography and Events section and a Promotions branch used for rent sound equipment.

The music studio split up because of internal issues...so WHAT TO DO WITH THE AMOUNT OF WRITTEN CODE!?

Share you work and knowledge is always a good choice! so i hope you could find some good material; I've been working on some code changes cause i'd like to let you try the complete functionality, once i'll be done the web will be avalibe and online.
